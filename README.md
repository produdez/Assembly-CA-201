**Description:**

This repository contains all labs from my assembly class. Including code and report for my assignment: `Implement binary search and quick sort using ASM`

I'll describe the assignment a bit more in this `README` file.

Detailed report of the assignment is [here](https://github.com/produdez/Assembly-CA-201/blob/master/Assignment/FinalWork/Report/report_mips.pdf)

## General Information

- Implemented binary sort, quick sort (pivot last elem)
- Tested performance using MAR MIPS built in benchmarking tool
- Quick sort was tested on worse case (already sorted array) and normal case (random array)
- Extra notes and remarks in report

## Screenshots

1. Quick sort benchmark
   | Worse Case | Normal case |
